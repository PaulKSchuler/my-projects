Together with Kristofer Jachnow, I explored the differences in lexical density between music genres. 
The final paper was part of an introductory course to Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig. 

The R-script was used to scrape the top hits per genre and find the corresponding lyrics in a first step and following this to conduct some simple descriptive analysis of the data found. 
It has to be noted that the script is two years old and has not been tested since.
